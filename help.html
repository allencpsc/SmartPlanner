<h3>Administrator Familiarization and Program Configuration</h3>
	<!-- admin administrator familiarization configuration -->
	<p>
		After launching, the administrator accesses the help menu with command 'help'. On the help menu, 
		the administrator sees a prompt to search by keywords for help articles. The administrator decides 
		to instead see all help articles by entering the command 'all'. The administrator learns about the main 
		functions of the program, including loading courses needed, setting maximum hours per semester, 
		selecting the schedule export types, and other functions. The administrator then begins configuration. 
		The administrator configures the course records by editing the 'Course Info' excel file, which is found 
		within the 'Smart Planner/input_files' directory. The administrator then changes the source directory for 
		the 'Course Info' file as desired by editing the 'config' file located in the 'Smart Planner' directory. 
		Next, the administrator sets the output format with the commands 'exports [exportNum]'. Next, the 
		administrator configures the destination path with the command 'destination [path]'. The administrator 
		then sets the default user interface to GUI with command 'gui'. The program is now configured for student use.
	</p>
	<h3>Load Needed Courses</h3>
	<!--load needed courses course classes class schedule input-->
	<p>
		To generate a schedule, the Smart Planner requires a valid DegreeWorks PDF from a student's DegreeWorks 
		portal as an input. To load needed courses via the GUI, the user can click 'Open Needed Courses', then 
		select the DegreeWorks PDF, then click 'Open'. To load needed courses via the CLI, the administrator can 
		either enter "load [fileName]" where 'fileName' is the local or absolute path, or enter "load-e" to open a file browser.
	</p>
	<h3>Set the Number of Hours Per Semester</h3>
	<!--hours set parameter per semester setup configure summer-->
	<p>
		To set the number of credit hours per semester, enter "hours[number]" where 'number' is the desired number 
		of hours per Fall or Spring semesters. Optionally, the user can enter the “summer-hours [number]” command to 
		set the hours per Summer semester.
	</p>
	<h3>Adjusting Configuration Data</h3>
	<!--config configuration setup settings administrate files custom customize-->
	<p>
		The configuration file (called "config") is located in the 'Smart Planner' directory  has the following 
		json format: the keys and values include "course_info_filename": the course info file path, "alias_filename": 
		the path of the file used for aliasing old course numbers, "is_graphical": true or false (whether using a GUI 
		or CLI), "initial_schedule_name": The default name used for path exports, "normal_hours_limit": 18 by default, 
		"strong_hours_limit": the hours upper limit that must be enforced (30 by default), "strong_hours_minimum": the 
		hours lower limit that must be enforced (4 by default)
	</p>
	<h3>CLI Scheduling</h3>
	<!-- generate run execute schedule create scheduling cli -->
	<p>
		The program will begin execution in the GUI environment by default. Click 'Enter Command Line' to enter the 
		CLI. The user loads needed courses with syntax 'load [fileName]', where 'fileName' is the name of the 
		DegreeWorks PDF containing all path to graduation requirements. The user should verify the parameters of 
		the current configuration with the 'parameters' command, which will output the file destination, the maximum 
		hours per semester, and all loaded courses. Then, the user will generate a schedule with the 'schedule' 
		command, receiving a positive completion output message. The user can then access their schedule.
	</p>
	<h3>GUI Scheduling</h3>
	<!-- graphical GUI schedule scheduling userstory -->
	<p>
	The program will begin execution in the GUI environment by default. If the user is currently in a CLI mode, enter 
	the GUI with command 'gui-i'. Once the GUI is launched, the user will have access to the following parameters: 
	load needed courses, set destination directory, set maximum hours per semester, set output format, and set output 
	file name. The help button is also available to assist with program execution. Pressing the return key after 
	entering the parameters is necessary. After the user modifies desired parameters, they press the 'generate schedule' 
	button. The schedule is now generated.
	</p>
	<h3>Program Interface</h3>
	<!-- graphical GUI CLI program view look interface -->
	<p>
	The program will begin execution in the GUI environment by default. If the user is currently in a CLI mode, the user 
	can enter the GUI with command 'gui-i'. Entering 'cli' will configure the interface to open in command line 
	interface mode by default. The same is the case with the “gui” command.
	</p>
	<h3>Validate Existing Path to Graduation</h3>
	<!-- existing validate user submit path -->
	<p>
		In order to assess a given path to graduation for correctness, the program must first have the relevant DegreeWorks 
		PDF as input. To validate an existing path to graduation in the GUI, the user first clicks the 'Verify Schedule' 
		button and selects the relevant DegreeWorks PDF. Then, if the Path to Graduation is valid, the program outputs 
		'path valid' and the confidence in the path. Otherwise, it outputs a list of the errors found in the path. The user 
		can also verify in the CLI by entering 'verify [filePath]'', where 'filePath' is the location of the Path to 
		Graduation Excel document.
	</p>
	<h3>AI Output Interpretation</h3>
	<!-- ai es artificial intelligence expert system interpretation confidence -->
	<p>
		After scheduling, the user will receive an output in the form of a decimal value between 0 and 100, where 0 reflects that
		the Expert System is very unconfident in the goodness of the Path to Graduation, and 100 reflects absolute confidence. All 
		Paths to Graduation are valid and satisfy CSU graduation requirements; this measure reflects a subjective judgment based 
		on rules provided by human scheduling experts.
	</p>
	<h3>Case Based Reasoning Overview</h3>
	<!-- ai case based reasoning cbr overview elective scheduling assistance -->
	<p>
			 	 	 	
Case Based Reasoning (CBR) uses past experiences to solve new problems. Previous experiences are stored in the system as 
Problem-Solution pairs. In the instance of the SmartPlanner CBR, a Problem is a students degreeworks file (courses taken 
and courses needed) and the Solution is the recommended electives (specifically, higher level CPSC electives). A user will 
select their input file, and the CBR will retrieve the recommended electives that best fit the user's degree plan. Then, 
the user has the option to “Adapt” the solution to their specific situation (i.e., if the system recommended three electives, 
but the student only needs two). After adaptation, the user can select an output file to overwrite the blank electives slots 
filled by the Rule Based Scheduler. The system will automatically write the input file and adapted solution back into the Case 
Base to be used in the future.

	</p>


	<h3>Logic Tree Overview</h3>
	<!-- logic tree string node -->
	<p>
		A complex logic structure of predictable format must be created to represent the complex requirements presented by a student's 
		DegreeWorks PDF. The complex logic arises from choices that are presented to the student by the DegreeWorks PDF. For example, 
		a student may be able to satisfy a certain graduation requirement by taking one of several combinations of different courses. 
		By creating this logic string while parsing an input DegreeWorks PDF, the Smart Planner is able to represent any possible 
		variation of graduation requirements and process them for scheduling and user interaction. This data structure is also used to 
		represent pre and co-requisites in the 'Course Info.xlsx' file. For more details on this topic, see the 'README_DEV.md'.
	</p>


	<h3>Navigating Requirements Tree</h3>
	<!-- logic tree node navigate requirements -->
	<p>
		After the logic tree string has been generated for a given DegreeWorks PDF, the user must be able to navigate the resulting 
		logical tree structure. The user enters the command “tree” from the main menu to enter the course selection menu. From the 
		course selection menu, the user navigates the structure of the tree by using the "show" command. "show-all" shows the entire 
		tree structure; “show-info [node]” shows the information for a given node. The user uses “move [node]”, “back”, “root”, and 
		“exit” to navigate. The “select [node]”, “deselect [node]”, “stub [node]”, and “unstub [node]” to change the selection and 
		stubbing status of the nodes. There are also administrative (can edit tree structure) and user modes (cannot edit tree structure) 
		that can be toggled with “admin” and “user” commands respectively. “Fill [node]” puts the user in the fill menu that fills out 
		protocol nodes. As an administrator, the “add-exhaustive”, “add-exhaustive”, “add-deliverable”, “add-protocol”, “add-shallow-count”, 
		“add-deep-count”, “add-deep-credit”, and “add-inserter” commands add new and empty nodes to the working node. The “delete [node]”, 
		“edit [node]”, “validate”, “copy [node]”, “cut [node]”, “paste” commands are also available. The user enters “commands” to see all 
		available commands. Note that all commands have a few aliases and shorthands. For more details on this topic, see the 
		'README_DEV.md'.
	</p>


	<h3>Database Updating</h3>
	<!-- fetch update database excel course info xlsx storage web crawler crawling -->
	<p>
		Our program database is an Excel document called 'Course Info.xlsx' located in the '/src/input_files' directory. For a full list 
		of what the database contains, see the 'Format of Course Info Input File' section of this help module. Using the CLI and the 
		'fetch' command, the administrator can update the entire database with an automated web crawler, which scrapes all relevant 
		information from the Columbus State University website. This ensures that all course information is up to date. Because the 
		database stores the information for each department on a different Excel sheet, the administrator can choose to update only 
		select department information by entering command 'fetch [departmentNomenclature]'. Ex: 'fetch CPSC'. Reference the CSU website 
		at <a>https://catalog.columbusstate.edu/course-descriptions/</a> for a full list of department nomenclatures. This functionality is 
		not available via the GUI. It is advised that all departments are updated concurrently.
	</p>


	<h3>Program Updates</h3>
	<!-- updates automatic version versioning  -->
	<p>
		The Smart Planner features automatic updates. When the program is launched, it will check the online repository for changes. 
		If changes are found, the user will be prompted to update the program accordingly. On the Windows OS, the Smart Planner will 
		install the new version of the software and close the program. On macOS, it will download a zip file containing the updated 
		executable to the user's downloads directory. The user must then extract the zip file and move it to their desired directory 
		for execution.
	</p>


	<h3>Alias Module</h3>
	<!-- course alias update renamed rename xlsx -->
	<p>
		The University will periodically rename courses during curriculum refactors/updates. For example, 'CPSC 5150' could be renamed 
		to 'CPSC 4150'. As such, aliasing is required to prevent such changes from breaking the Smart Planner. To add a course to be 
		aliased after such a change, the administrator navigates to the 'alias.xlsx' file, puts the outdated course ID under the 'old_id' 
		column, and puts the updated course ID in the 'new_id' column.
